# Fellahin

Fellahin is a light overhaul modification for Empire Total War primarily made to fix and rebalance the Eastern factions gameplay in grand campaign.

Ever wondered why Crimean Khanate uses cossack troops instead of it's native tatar cavalry and irregular musketeers? \
Or why Maratha bargir infantry is stronger than any western line? \
And did you even know Morocco and Barbary States can recruit fellahin musketeers and swordsmen - their only decent troops? And that these are only available in initially Ottoman-held Middle East?

This mod addresses all of the above and much more.
